## Server-side Rendering Skeleton

Lots of configuration goes into setting up a React application with server-side rendering. I made this so that I have a light-weight starting point for future projects. Maybe others will find it helpful too.

_Why not just one of the million existing React boilerplates?_ -- Yes, the world doesn't need any more React boilerplates, but I made this from scratch so that I could understand how it works completely.


### Setup

Use `yarn run dev` to start the application in development mode.
Use `yarn run start` to start the application in production mode.
